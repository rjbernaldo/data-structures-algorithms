1. What does it mean to partition a number of data items?
- Given a pivot, sort the items into two groups, one less than the pivot, and one more than the pivot.
2. What is the name given to the value used to separate the two groups into when partitioning?
- Pivot
3. Describe briefly how the C++ code that carries out the partitioning algorithm works.
- Track the elements to the left and right of a data set. Continually move them closer to the pivot swapping as needed if one is smaller (or larger) than the pivot.
4. True or false: The partitioning algorithm runs in O(N) time.
- True
5. Briefly describe the operation of the quicksort algorithm.
- Partition the data set, then partition the first half and partition the second half.
6. What is the name of the data item whose key is the same as the pivot value?
- Pivot?
7. How do we pick the pivot in the quicksort examples in this hour?
- Rightmost item for simplicity.
