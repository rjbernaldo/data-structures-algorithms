1. Complete the sentence: A recursive function is one that... 
- Calls itself
2. The value of the eighth triangular number is...
- 8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 = 36
3. True or false: Recursion is used because it is moreefficient.
- False. Recursion is used because it is easier to visualize (in some cases.)
4. What is a base case?
- A case or a state when you dont have to call the recursive function again. As youve reached the simplest case. You then just return the base.
5. Describe briefly how to anagram a word.
- Rotate the word, then perform anagram on remaining N-1 letters. This is usually done N times or until each letter has been put in the first position (Fully rotate entire word.)
6. Whatâ€™s the advantage of the recursive approach to binary searches, as opposed to the loop approach?
- Easier to visualize and code.
7. True or false: A recursive approach can be replaced with a stack-based approach.
- True.
8. In a recursive approach to a binary search, what two things does the recursive function call itself to do?
- Run function on lower half or on upper half.
