1. True or false: A stack works on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle.
- False. It works on the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle.
2. Name two ways stacks and queues differ from arrays.
- Stacks are LIFO, queues are FIFO. You can only interact with the last (or first) item in the set. They are most often used as programmers tools.
3. True or false: A good analogy for a stack is the line of people waiting at the bank
teller’s window.
- False. That is a queue. A good example is a stack of letters.
4. Define push and pop.
- Push adds an element on the top (or end) of the set and pop removes it.
5. True or false: If there’s only one item in a stack, the bottom of the stack is the same as the top.
- True
6. In the C++ code that pushes an item onto a stack, should you insert the item first or increment the top first?
- Increment first.
