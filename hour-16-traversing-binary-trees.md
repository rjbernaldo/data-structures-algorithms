1. What three tasks should a recursive function execute to perform an inorder traversal?
- Visit left node, view current node, view right node.
2. What is the base case in such traversals?
- When current node is null.
3. Hereâ€™s an expression in postfix notation: AB+C-. Express this in infix notation.
- (A+B)-C
4. Describe how to find the node with the maximum key value in a binary search tree.
- Continue traversing the tree to the right until the next pointer is null.
5. The number of steps involved searching and insertion in a binary tree is proportional to what aspect of the tree?
- Level or depth.
6. The efficiency of binary search trees in BigO notation is_________.
- O(LogN)
7. In C++, what two data members must the Node class contain?
