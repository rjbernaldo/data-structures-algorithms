1. When you implement a stack using a linked list rather than an array, what is the chief difference noticed by a user of the stack class?
- None, that is why a stack is an ADT.
2. True or false: An abstract C++ class is one whose interface is not yet clearly defined.
- False. An abstract class is whose interface is defined but its implementation hidden.
3. What does implementation mean?
- How a certain entity is coded.
4. What is an ADT?
- Abstract data types are classes that introduce abstraction when it comes to implementation. It only shows the user its interface.
5. Is a stack an example of an ADT?
- Yes. It only shows its interface but actual impelemtation can be a Linked List or an Array for example.
6. Would it make sense to implement an array using astack?
- No
7. Is a linked list an example of an ADT?
- No because we know that a linked list is implemented in a certain way (Abstration is not required.)
