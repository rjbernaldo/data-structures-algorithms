1. What does partially sorted mean?
- Although the items are indeed sorted, it is not the 'final' order as other items still need to be checked and may be inserted into this set.
2. During the insertion sort, where is the marked item placed?
- Temporary variable. It is eventually inserted into the sorted set.
3. What is one reason the insertion sort is more efficient than the sorted group?
- It does not execute the inner loop if the two items compared are already sorted
- It performs shifting rather than swapping
4. True or false: When using the insertion sort on N items, memory space for N*2 items is required.
- False. A space of only N+1 is required.
5. True or false: The insertion sort runs in O(N2) time, the same as the bubble sort.
- True, but often times it is less.
6. Define the term stable as applied to sorting.
- Being able to retain secondary sorting. A sort is stable if the order of the items with the same 'key' is retained.
7. When would you use a bubble sort as opposed to an insertion sort?
- When dataset is very very small. When simplicity is more important than speed.
