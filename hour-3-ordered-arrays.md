1) Why is an ordered array better than an unordered array?
- Faster search, but slower insertion and deletion
2) In one sentence, how does binary search work?
- Dividing the data set by two until you find the element
3) What is the maximum number of comparisons necessary when performing a binary search of 100,000 items?
- log(100,000) * 3.332 = roughly arround 17 steps
4) What is the equation that tells you how many steps a binary search will take if you already know the size of the range to be searched?
- log(N) base 2
5) True or false: Only simple variables like int can be stored in a data structure.
- False
6) What is the purpose of Big O notation?
- Determine how efficient an algorithm is based on input size
7) Big O notation specifies a relationship between two variables. What are these variables?
- N and T. Input size and time.
