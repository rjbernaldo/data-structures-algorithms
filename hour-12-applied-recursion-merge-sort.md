1. Define the term subtree as used in our discussion of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. 
- Subtree is the entire tree minus the base
2. Briefly describe the recursive solution to the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
- Move the top subtree (minus the base) to the intermediary pole, move the base to the destination pole, then move the entire subtree on the intermediary pole on top of the base on the destination spot
3. True or false: The merge sort is faster than the insertion sort.
- True
4. What does it mean to merge two arrays?
- Combine both arrays into a single array
5. Briefly describe the merge sort.
- Split array into two, then sort them into a third array. Repeat split until array has one element.
6. What is the base case for the merge sort?
- When the array has only one element
7. What is the Big O efficiency of the merge sort?
- N*LogN
